# psbeam
A modest attempt to interface certain aspects of the Erlang BEAM with Powershell.

## Getting Started

You can build the dll via the build.ps1 file included in the repo.  Or you can call MSBuild directly.

Once you've built the file, you can import the cmdlets via *Import-Module*.

Many thanks to Fred Hebert for his guidance on getting this project started.
